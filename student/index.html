		<h2>I am Jose Florante A Reyes III</h2>
		<p> In college days, Im just simple student. Im not smart but hardworking person. Im so proud that I graduated as a BSIT.  I graduated in 2015. I just want to share my experience in my college days. During my time in College days I had it really good moments, but my best moments that I've experienced are in a particular programing class (web dev) during my first year. So I was basically a new student in these kind of classes. I remember my first programing exercise it was in this class. I was able to build a simple form but then again my professor want me to explain how did i do that. I didn't want to do it, but finally I did it and that one was my best moment. When I went to explain I felt afraid, and then when I explain I felt so good for the effort I applied on. on that moment i felt like I am the king of the word during that time I was very proud at myself explaining it smoothly to classmates. Now I feel so confedence. The learnings that I acquire made it so good this moment because I know that I have to trust on me. Something teachers or students can learn from my experience is that we have to overcome our fears and not let them control ourselves because we can't know our capabilities if we are afraid.

		<h2>Here I studied as a BSIT </h2>
		<p>I graduated in Informatics Northgate Alabang. Tuition  is affordable. The school itself is very small. But the quality of the classroom and school itself is very nice. There are a few teachers who speak strictly English but most teachers speak Taglish. You can be an Informatics graduate and beat any student graduating from UP, DLSU, or Ateneo if you can prove you have top-notch English skills and have a lot of work experience. Informatics isn`t the best but it does offer great quality learning environment and very supportive teachers. If you want to graduate and get a job after graduation, here`s a tip don`t blame the school for you not getting a job. Blame yourself. You have to ask for help or look for jobs yourself. Like I said, a degree proves determination and perseverance.
