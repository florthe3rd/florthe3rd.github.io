		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<fieldset>
		<p id="name">Hey there! My name is Jose Florante A Reyes III.</p>
		<p>Im 24 years of age, I quit my corporate job at Alorica as CSR Agent to pursue my dreams. As a Adventurer I will fight and conquer my dreams, It seems like climbing a Mountain I will never stop until i reach at the top.  It feels like crazy, especially because I was young and broke but this  is not a hindrance to pursue my dreams.</p>

		<h2>My Story</h2>
		<fieldset>
		<p>One time in my life firstime doing a mountain climbing, I was invited by my sister(Aila reyes) to climb mountain in Mt.Ulap. I was very excited and also uncertain. i feel excited because at last something new is happening in my life. i feel uncertain because I don't know who is included, of course I feel uncertain because it was my sisters colleague. I accept the ivitation by my sister and she said- "sa wakas may mag aalalay sakin".</p>

		<p>on the trip going to the destination, i was very shy so im so quiet. i fell in  sleep on the trip. I was accidentaly sleeping at the shoulder of my sister colleague her name is Ferlina Yangyan.</p>	

		<div><p><img src="https://scontent.fmnl4-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16298681_1518442914852206_5070597171084310539_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl4-4.fna&oh=9e919d149cfdf5db3eeec8e335183462&oe=5CE9A62F"><br>(Ferlina Yangyan)</p></div>

		<p>we reach at the destination. I was shock on what i see, the moutain is so big i was thinking that it's a long climb. as we started climbing im so very engetic i packed all the  things that i bring in my bag. in the middle of  climbing , i was so regretful that i bring all the things in my bag. it was very hard carrying 50kg while hiking. i was thinking on myself-"bakit ako nandidito?".</p>

		<p>as we reach at the top of the mountain i was amaze by the beauty of god creation. i was thinking on myself-"eto ang sagot bakit ako nandidito".</p>
		
		<div><p><img src="https://scontent.fmnl4-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16388117_1518441808185650_8404035754923064500_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl4-3.fna&oh=382bdcad6964cf6ca787c0bfdba50b29&oe=5CF4E7D6"><br>(At the top of MT.Ulap)</p></div>

		<p>at top of the moutain i got the chance to talk with ferlina, i was apologizing to her on what ive done along the way and we talk lots of thing and i enjoy it and we are friends on that day.</p>

		<div><p><img src="https://scontent.fmnl4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16425774_1518719948157836_4996057598200099057_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl4-1.fna&oh=2f650419d956ad7ca7eb89f272881131&oe=5CDD9D47"><br>(Currently we are in a Relationship)</p></div>

		<p>i just realize in this adventure if you dont give up on to your challanges  you will receive lots of good things in your life. as a adventurer in life i am always thinking positively in times of difficulty. i never stop fighting to reach my dreams.</p>
